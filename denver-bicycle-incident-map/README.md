[Denver Bicycle Incident Map](https://pchuck.shinyapps.io/denver-bicycle-incident-map)
was developed to visualize patterns in traffic accidents involving
cyclists since 2011.

* **Select** a date range from the year slider
* **Toggle** the checkbox to display incidents classified as hit and run

The interactive map is part of a larger [exploratory analysis of
Denver traffic](https://github.com/pchuck/denver-traffic), which
includes data on automobile, cyclist and pedestrian involved incidents.

Data is acquired from the [Open Data Catalog](https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-traffic-accidents) and is based on
vehicle accident reports collected by police districts and precincts
within the city and county of Denver.

The application is written in R and utilizes the Shiny and Leaflet libraries.
