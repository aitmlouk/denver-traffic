[Denver Bicycle Incident Map](https://pchuck.shinyapps.io/denver-bicycle-incident-map)
was developed to visualize patterns in traffic accidents involving
cyclists between 2011 and 2016.

* **Select** a date range from the year slider
* **Toggle** the checkbox to display incidents classified as hit and run

The visualization is part of a larger [exploratory analysis of
Denver traffic](https://github.com/pchuck/denver-traffic), which
includes data on automobile, cyclist and pedestrian involved incidents.

Data is acquired from the Open Data Catalog and is based on
vehicle accident reports collected by police districts and precincts
within the city and county of Denver.

The application is written in R and utilizes the Shiny and Leaflet libraries.
